# crmDjango
This CRM is ddeveloped for an institute who will be involved in trainng and consultancy service. I only have the lead tracker code with me in this project.
Includes Invoice genrator.

You have to login as a super user at first.
And create a user from this super user.

This is just REST api code,
We have Dashboard that provides with the number of leads with their phone numbers.

Remeber only Super User can login at begning.
And super user can access user regarding oprations.

All rest call built inside test.py and then views.py
